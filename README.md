RTS on spring cloud.
https://roadmap.sh/projects/realtime-leaderboard-system

Although there might be bugs because of a lack of the tests(little does websocket and gateway is covered tests), however basically  leaderbaord (core technology works fine).

Technology stack is: 

- Java (17+)
- Spring boot(3.5.1/4.0.3)
- Kafka
- Redis
- Postgresql
- Debezium
- keycloak
- websockets
- vault
  
Docker-compose can be lagged behind lightweight.

The project still in progress, however I suggest that after tests and debugging, i will finish it.
